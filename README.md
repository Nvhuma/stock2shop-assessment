# Stock2Shop API Assessment - Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

This project demonstrates a data synchronization workflow between Shopify and a hypothetical ERP system, showcasing API integration, data transformation, and structured export capabilities. The implementation retrieves product data from Shopify, transforms it into a standardized format, and exports it in three formats (JSON, CSV, SQL) ready for ERP import.

---

## 1. API Choice: Shopify REST API

### Why REST over GraphQL?

We selected the Shopify REST API for the following reasons:

**Simplicity** - REST is more straightforward for this use case of product retrieval. A single GET request returns all needed data without query construction overhead.

**Documentation** - Shopify's REST API documentation is mature, well-indexed, and widely used across integrations, making it easier to troubleshoot issues.

**One-off Integration** - For a single sync operation, REST requires minimal setup compared to GraphQL, which is optimized for complex, multi-resource queries.

**Maintainability** - Junior developers can understand and maintain REST calls more easily than GraphQL queries.

**Performance Note** - GraphQL would be preferred for complex scenarios requiring multiple resources simultaneously (products + inventory + pricing + fulfillment data), but this straightforward product retrieval is better served by REST.

## 2. API Endpoints Used

### Main Endpoint

```
GET https://{store}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{version}/products.json
```

### Authentication

**Method**: Custom App with Admin API access token

**Header**: 
```
X-Shopify-Access-Token: {token}
```

**Scopes Required**:
- `read_products` - Grants permission to read product data
- `read_inventory` - Grants permission to read inventory quantity on variants

### Query Parameters

```
?fields=id,title,variants&limit=250
```

- **fields** - Limits response to only essential fields (improves performance and reduces bandwidth)
- **limit** - Sets pagination limit to 250 products per request (Shopify max)

## 3. Data Transformation Logic

### Input â†’ Output Mapping

| Shopify Field | ERP Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| product.id | product_id | Shopify's internal product identifier |
| product.title | product_title | Product name/description |
| variant.id | variant_id | Each product can have multiple variants (sizes, colors, etc.) |
| variant.sku | sku | Stock Keeping Unit - unique inventory identifier |
| variant.price | price | Converted to float for calculation readiness |
| variant.inventory_quantity | inventory_quantity | Available stock count |
| (generated) | sync_timestamp | ISO format timestamp for audit trail |

### Key Design Decision: One Variant = One ERP Record

Since SKUs are stored on variant objects (not the product object), each variant becomes a separate line item in the ERP output. This is standard ERP practice where inventory is tracked by SKU, not by product. A single product with 3 color variants generates 3 output records.

### Output Formats Provided

#### 1. JSON - Machine-Readable, Nested Structure

**File**: `products_rest.json`

**Use Case**: APIs, data warehouses, JavaScript applications

**Example**:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "products": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {

            "title": "Classic Leather Sneaker",
            "variants": {
              "edges": [
                {
                  "node": {

## 4. Challenges & Assumptions

### Challenge 1: SKU Location

**Problem**: SKUs are not stored on the product object in Shopify; they exist on variant objects nested within products.

**Solution**: The script iterates through each product's variants array and extracts the SKU from each variant. This is also where the inventory_quantity field is located.

**Code Pattern**:
```python
for product in products:
    for variant in product.get("variants", []):
        sku = variant.get("sku")
        inventory = variant.get("inventory_quantity")
```

### Challenge 2: Missing SKUs

**Problem**: Some variants might not have SKUs defined in Shopify (user error or legacy data).

**Solution**: The script exports "N/A" as a placeholder. In production, this would trigger a data quality alert requiring manual correction before ERP import.

### Challenge 3: Price Format

**Problem**: Shopify returns prices as strings (e.g., "29.99") but ERPs require numeric types for calculations.

**Solution**: Convert prices to float type during transformation. This ensures mathematical operations (discounts, tax calculations) work correctly.

```python
price = float(variant.get("price", 0))
```

### Challenge 4: Pagination

**Problem**: Large catalogs may exceed the 250-product limit per API request.

**Solution**: Current implementation fetches up to 250 products. For production with larger catalogs, implement pagination using the `Link` header response or `cursor` parameter for subsequent requests.

### Assumptions Made

**One Organization** - All products in this test store belong to a single ERP client. Multi-tenant scenarios would require filtering by organization ID.

**No Deletions** - The script handles only new and updated products. Deleted products would require a separate sync mechanism or soft-delete tracking.

**SKU Availability** - While "N/A" is used as a placeholder, the assumption is that most variants will have SKUs defined.

**One-Time Sync** - This is a one-time data pull. Production would require a scheduled job running daily or weekly with change detection.

**No Error Recovery** - If a single product fails to parse, the script continues processing. Production would require transaction rollback and detailed error logging.

## 5. Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: Authentication Failed (401 Error)

**Symptoms**: 
```
Error: 401 Unauthorized
```

**Diagnosis**:
- Access token is invalid, expired, or corrupted
- Store URL has a typo or is in wrong format
- API version doesn't exist in your Shopify instance

**Solution**:
1. Verify access token in Shopify Partner Dashboard (copy directly, check for extra spaces)
2. Regenerate the token if it's been inactive or you suspect expiration
3. Confirm store URL format: `store-name.myshopify.com` (NOT `https://store-name.myshopify.com`)
4. Verify API version exists (check in Shopify Admin > Apps and integrations > API credentials)

### Problem: No Products Returned (Empty Array)

**Symptoms**:
```
[âœ“] Successfully retrieved 0 product(s)
```

**Diagnosis**:
- Test store hasn't had products added yet
- API credentials lack the `read_products` scope
- Query filters are too restrictive

**Solution**:
1. Add 2-3 sample products to your development store
2. Verify scopes in Shopify app settings:
   - Go to Settings > Admin API access scopes
   - Ensure `read_products` and `read_inventory` are checked
3. Remove query filters (`?fields=`, `?limit=`) temporarily to retrieve all data

### Problem: Missing SKUs or "N/A" Values

**Symptoms**:
```
sku: "N/A"
```

**Diagnosis**:
- Variants in Shopify weren't assigned SKUs during product creation
- SKUs were deleted after initial setup
- Variants are in draft status

**Solution**:
1. In Shopify Admin, go to Products and edit each product
2. Add SKUs to all variants before syncing
3. Ensure variants are in "Active" status (not Draft or Archived)
4. Re-run the sync after making changes

### Problem: Inventory Quantities Are 0 or Incorrect

**Symptoms**:
```
inventory_quantity: 0 (but you know you have stock)
```

**Diagnosis**:
- Inventory wasn't allocated to any location
- Shopify tracks inventory per physical location, but script retrieves only the default location
- Stock was reserved or allocated elsewhere

**Solution**:
1. Verify inventory is set in Shopify Admin > Products > [Product] > Inventory
2. Check the location - inventory must be allocated to the default location
3. If using multi-location inventory, enhance the script to specify `location_id` parameter
4. Check for reserved inventory (stock allocated to orders but not yet fulfilled)

### Problem: Price is Missing or Shows as 0

**Symptoms**:
```
price: 0 or price: null
```

**Diagnosis**:
- Price wasn't set on the variant
- Variant is in draft status
- Currency conversion issue (unlikely but possible)

**Solution**:
1. Verify all variants have prices in Shopify Admin
2. Check variant status - should be "Active" not "Draft"
3. Confirm currency is consistent across all products
4. Check if variant is marked as a "hidden" variant

### Script Descriptions

**run_all.py** - Orchestrates the entire workflow. Calls fetch and transform scripts in sequence, generates all output files.

**fetch_products_rest.py** - Connects to Shopify API using REST, retrieves products with variants, returns structured data.

**fetch_products_graphql.py** - Alternative GraphQL implementation. Not used for primary output but provided for reference and potential use in production.

**transform.py** - Takes raw Shopify data and transforms it into the standardized ERP format. Handles data type conversion, field mapping, and timestamp generation.

---

## 8. Production Considerations

### What Would Be Different in Production

**Scheduling** - Implement a scheduled job (cron, AWS Lambda, Celery) to run syncs daily or weekly rather than manually.

**Error Handling** - Add comprehensive logging, retry logic with exponential backoff, and alerting on sync failures.

**Duplicate Detection** - Query the ERP system to check if a product already exists before inserting; update instead of insert for existing items.

**Data Validation** - Enforce required fields, validate prices are positive, inventory is non-negative, SKUs are non-empty.

**Audit Trail** - Track which user initiated the sync, IP address, timestamp, number of records processed, and any errors encountered.

**Pagination** - Implement cursor-based pagination or Link header parsing for catalogs exceeding 250 products.

**Change Detection** - Query only products updated since the last sync using Shopify's `updated_at` field to reduce API calls.

**Location Awareness** - Handle multi-location inventory scenarios by querying the `inventory_levels` endpoint for each location.

**Transaction Handling** - Wrap batch database inserts in transactions to ensure atomicity; rollback entire sync on any error.

**Monitoring & Alerting** - Build a dashboard showing last sync time, record count, error rate, and performance metrics.
